## 💡 Tips for Success

### Screenshots

- **Use real functionality:** Actual console logs look more authentic
- **Hide credentials:** Use dummy/example credentials in screenshots
- **Clean environment:** Close unnecessary browser tabs/windows
- **Good lighting:** If showing UI, ensure good contrast
- **Annotations optional:** Can add arrows/highlights if needed

### Promotional Image

- **Keep it simple:** Don't overcrowd with text
- **High contrast:** Ensure text is readable at small sizes
- **Brand consistent:** Use SIP.js colors if possible
- **Professional:** Avoid clipart, use quality icons
- **Test preview:** View at different sizes before submitting

### Submission

- **Copy-paste ready:** All text in `store-assets/store-listing.txt`
- **Double-check:** Review preview before submitting
- **Save drafts:** Chrome Web Store auto-saves, but be careful
- **Be patient:** Review takes 1-3 days, don't rush
