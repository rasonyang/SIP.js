=================================================================
DEVELOPER RESPONSES TO POTENTIAL REVIEWER QUESTIONS:
=================================================================

Q: Why does the extension need wildcard WebSocket permissions (wss://*/*/*)?
A: Users configure their own SIP servers which can be on any domain or IP address. The extension is designed to work with any SIP provider (FreeSWITCH, Asterisk, BroadSoft, etc.). Users explicitly enter their server URL in the options page before any connections are made.

Q: How do users interact with this extension if it has no UI?
A: The extension is "headless" by design - it's intended for technical users who monitor activity via Chrome DevTools console. Configuration is done through the Extension Options page. All SIP events, call status, and errors are logged to the console. This is explicitly documented in the store listing and user manual.

Q: What user data does this extension collect?
A: The extension only stores user-provided SIP credentials locally (using chrome.storage.sync). No data is sent to third parties, the extension developers, or any analytics services. All network communication is between the user's browser and their configured SIP server. See our privacy policy for full details.

Q: Is this extension legitimate/safe?
A: Yes. This extension is open source (MIT license) and the code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/onsip/SIP.js. It's built by the SIP.js project, a well-established JavaScript SIP library. Users can inspect the source code to verify there is no malicious behavior.
